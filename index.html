    <h2>position: absolute;</h2>

    <p>An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of
        positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed):</p>

    <div class="relative">This div element has position: relative;
        <div class="absolute">This div element has position: absolute;
            It is 90 pixels high but I wonder what will happen if we add more text in it that this height can
            accomodate.
            This is extra test for testing the height, what happens to the height, does the text overflow both divs
            for example? Yes it does, overflow both divs.
