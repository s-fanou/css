    <p style="color:blueviolet">
        This is some text in the Paragraph. The paragraph is assigned 3 different color styles in this order:
    <ul>
        <li>1. from the styles.css file => color Navy.</li>
        <li>2. in header style tag => color Brown.</li>
        <li>3. In-line => color blueviolet.</li>
    </ul>

    The final color is blueviolet therefore the inline wins (takes precedence). Notice that the closing tag of the paragraph is below this
    text yet the color here is default black. The UL is also within the paragraph yet its color is also default black. Which means that
    the UL interupts the styling of the paragraph and from then on the default black applies. Also notice that the UL does not take 
    the style from the paragraph even though it is within it.
