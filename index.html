    <div class="your-class-name">
        <p>This is a line of text.
        The length or height of a div is as big as the content it contains
        As I put more lines of text the height becomes bigger to accomodate.</p>  

        <div id="my-div">THIS IS A DIV WITHIN A DIV. It inherits the color style from the div above but NOT the rest of the styles. 
            For example it does not inherit margin and padding from the above div. 
            So it seems that only certain styles are inherited from the parent. the text remains within the div as the size changes
            but if there is overflow, AND I KEEP TYPING AND TYPING AND TYPING
        </div>

    <div class="your-class-name">
        <p><strong>This is a line of text in second div. for float: left to work (to make a row of divs I must use a fixed size e.g. 500px. Percentage does not work with float </strong>

        <div id="my-div">THIS IS A DIV WITHIN A DIV. Both divs have float : left which should create a row of 2 divs but it does not work if I use width 50%
