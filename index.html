    <div>
        This is a line of text. <br>
        The length or height of a div is as big as the content it contains <br>
        As I put more lines of text the height becomes bigger to accomodate. <br>

        <p>This is a paragraph I have not put any styling on, just want to see if it 
            inherits the color from its parent the div. Yes it does.
        </p> 
        
        <span> This is text in a span. It also inherits the styling of the div 
            <p>This is a paragraph within the div and the > span, 2 levels inside where the style is applied 
                yet it still inherits the style.
            </p>
