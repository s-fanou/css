        This is some text in the Paragraph. The paragraph is assigned different color styles from both different sources
        e.g. css file and style tag and diferent types, e.g. class or ID types. The final color is RED therefore the
        inline wins (takes precedence) from all of them. OPEN THIS FILE IN THE CHROME DEV TOOLS. IT SHOWS
        THE PRECEDENCE OF ALL AND IN ORDER FROM BOTTOM TO TOP. Bottom has less precedence, top has more.
