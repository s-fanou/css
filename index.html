    <label><strong>Different styles types e.g. class, id, inline and from different sources, e.g. css file,
        style tag, inline assigned to the same element. Which one has precedence?
        </strong></label>

    <p id="one" class="dot-one" style="color:red">
        This is some text in the Paragraph. The paragraph is assigned 3 different color styles in this order:
    <ul>
        <li>1. from the styles.css file => color Blue.</li>
        <li>2. in header style tag (which is after the link to style.css) => color Brown.</li>
        <li>3. In-line => color Red.</li>
    </ul>

    The final color is RED therefore the inline wins (takes precedence). Notice that the closing tag of the paragraph is
    below this
    text yet the color here is default black. The UL is also within the paragraph yet its color is also default black.
    Which means that
    the UL interrupts the styling of the paragraph and from then on the default black applies. Also notice that the UL
    does not take
    the style from the paragraph even though it is within it.
