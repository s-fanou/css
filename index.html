        <p>This is a line of text.
            The length or height of a div is as big as the content it contains
            As I put more lines of text the height becomes bigger to accomodate.</p>

        <div id="my-div">THIS IS A DIV WITHIN A DIV. It inherits the color style from the div above but NOT the rest of
            the styles.
            For example it does not inherit margin and padding from the above div.
            So it seems that only certain styles are inherited from the parent.

    <div class="fixed-top">
        This div element has position: fixed; It seems that position fixed ignores any body padding.
