    <label><strong>Different styles types e.g. class, id, inline assigned to the same element
            which one has precedence?
        </strong></label>

    <p id="one" class="dot-one">
        This is some text in the Paragraph. The paragraph is assigned 3 different color styles in the same source
        the styles.css file but of different types:
    <ul>
        <li>1. The 'p' paragraph selector => color Blue.</li>
        <li>2. class dot-one => color orange.</li>
        <li>3. ID one => color Green.</li>
    </ul>

    The final color is GREEN therefore the ID wins (takes precedence). OPEN THIS FILE IN THE CHROME DEV TOOLS. IT SHOWS
    THE
    PRECEDENCE FROM BOTTOM TO TOP. Notice that the closing tag of the paragraph is
    below this
    text yet the color here is default black. The UL is also within the paragraph yet its color is also default black.
    Which means that
    the UL interrupts the styling of the paragraph and from then on the default black applies. Also notice that the UL
    does not take
    the style from the paragraph even though it is within it.
